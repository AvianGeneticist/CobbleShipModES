	description "Blaster weapons are tiny, so some enterprising mechanics will try to get more out of them by creating larger artillery batteries like these. The resultant weapon still isn't particularly remarkable, but such stacking of weapons is an easy way to cram more power into smaller weapon ports."

	description "This rotating assembly of 6 blasters is capable of outputting a large barrage of sustained fire. An electric motor drives the assembly, consuming power passsively but allowing the gun to dissipate heat even wile not firing, as the barrels act like external radiators."
	description "The design of the Vulcan Blaster also includes experimental projectile generators that are more energy efficient, resulting in a more affordable experience. However, the coils need to cool down briefly after prolonged use, resulting in a need for a brief bit of downtime between volleys."

	description "A Vulcan Blaster assembly mounted on a turret port. Though one of the slower turrets available on the market, the firepower of the equipped Vulcan Blaster is left completely unchanged, allowing it to be a deadly weapon when multiple turrets focus on a single target."
	description "Sadly, however, the addition of the turret swivel does little to negate the considerable heat cost of firing the weapon, and the accuracy of the turret is a bit worse than the fixed version."

	description "This rather bulky turret carries four modified blasters on one mount, providing a staggering amount of power -- and heat consumption. Though far from the largest of turrets humanity has to offer, the combination of a quadruple armament and the already hot-running modified blaster is that the gun exerts a ton of heat."

	description "A highly advanced particle gun that ablates the enemy with magnetically charged clumps of mass that seek targets, unleashing their contained energy upon impact. Though the homing is only marginally effective, this weapon excels against large warships that have trouble moving out of the way."
	description "Magnet bombs have far better locking on targets of great size, and their tightly clumped magnetic 'bullets' last for what some consider an annoyingly long time. Additionally, they produce a surprisingly low amount of heat."

	description "A broad-wave magnetic turret that blasts massive pulses of magnetic porjectiles out in waves. Each individual shot is far weaker than a normal magnet bomb shot, but retains the homing capability. Designed to be mounted on capital ships, it is prohibitively huge."

	description "The Navy's Torpedoes are a difficult problem for many ships to deal with: slow but sturdy, many captains feel a deep loathing for the large, well-protected warheads. However, with some creative tampering, the anti-missile shots of a turret can be dramatically increased in power and range - at the cost of firing speed."
	description "The Precision Anti-Missile Turret fires very slowly (enough that a single sidewinder missile launcher is enough to overwhelm a single turret) but is capable of always destroying a torpedo in one go, with a healthy range to boot."

	description "Vulcan-class weapons have become synonymous with large-caliber rotary weaponry in recent times, even though traditionally, a vulcan was designed to fire explosive shells at high speed from multiple rotating barrels."
	description "While a Javelin missile isn't exactly an explosive shell, the innovative compressed design of this quintuple barreled rotating missile launcher has drawn plenty of notice from those looking to dish out some serious firepower. In addition, the gun is able to be driven by the propulsive forces exerted by its projectiles, resulting in the weapon being exceptionally energy efficient without needing an external motor."
	description "Though much more massive than most ships will allow, it is exceptionally power- and heat-efficient as a main gun, offsetting its otherwise debilitating size."

	description "A single heavy rocket launcher, mounted onto a turret mount. As heavy missiles lack guidance systems, having a launcher able to swivel towards tight concentrations of targets independent of the ship it's mounted on is a boon in combat."
	description "As the turret consists of only a single launcher, the fire rate is the same as the standard front-mounted variant. The larger mount, however, does allow the weapon to carry some more ammo."
