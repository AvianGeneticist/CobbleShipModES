	description "This outfit expands and hardens the necessary componentry in your ship to enable the use of more powerful weapons."
	description "	The cost of this, however, is that said componentry is both space-demanding and volatile, so this is an inefficient use of outfit space and with make your ship's hull more fragile."

	description "This expansion allows you to cram more power into your engine block via some careful expansion and reorganizing of engine ports."
	description "	Of course, such core reorganization starts to encroach on your ship's normal outfit space, and punching new holes in the rear of your ship will render it a bit more frail."

	"energy capacity" 175
	description "Power Cells are a special kind of fuel cell with an integrated supercapacitor for energy storage, designed for ships that run at extremely specific energy levels. Because they're made so specifically, all power cells are custom-made for the ships they're installed in -- though nothing's stopping you from 'repurposing' the power cell of a ship for use on another."
	description "Power Cells tend to be a bit less heat efficient than fuel cells of a similar caliber due to their customized nature, but the extra power storage can be a boon on ships where heat dissipation is high and outfit capacity is low."
	description "This particular low-power option is designed for the Light variant of the Anti-Missile Drone."

	description "This is a larger power cell, designed for the Heavy Anti-Missile Drone. Custom made to support a heavy anti-missile turret, engines, and even a tiny shield generator, the larger cell actually has its uses on non-drone ships, and is thus sold separately in some outfitters."
	description "In addition to producing more power (and heat), the larger power cell setup also sports a much more robust power storage system."

	description "A miniscule shield generator, barely even capable of charging shields at all, designed for those who absolutely NEED to squeeze a shield generator into any ship, no matter how little outfit space they have left. In particular, the Heavy Anti-Missile Drone is a particularly common example; it was the first drone designed with regenerating shields in mind."

	description "A simple expansion to your shield matrix that does not regenerate shields, instead acting like a 'battery' that allows greater shield density and strength."
	description "	Most captains will argue that a shield generator is a better use of space, but for some smaller ships, the insurance against high-payload weapons like torpedoes is considered worth it."

	description "A secondary shield system consisting of a massive shield matrix system and a small generator. Designed with warships and other large craft in mind, they can prove effective against foes with weaker weapons."
	description "	Like normal shield generators, the system requires power, however being an entirely separate system, also requires dedicated crew to operate."

	description "A super low-power generation option that can be bolted to the exterior of any ship with the right connections, manufactured by Deep Sky (the leaders in low energy heat-to-power generation technology). It is more space efficient than crude fuel cell technology, but produces much less power than advanced generators. As thermocouples work by cycling heat from a hot medium to a cold one, they can also serve as very weak cooling apparati."
