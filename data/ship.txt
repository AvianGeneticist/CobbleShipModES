	description "Unlike most other ships, fighters have an upper limit to what sizes they can reach, as carrier bays are standardized in size across human space. The Bumblebee manages to squeeze around these constraints by being as boxy as possible, with its wings able to retract into the main body of the ship during docking to facilitate some amount of elegance."
	description "That said, the Bumblebee is the largest recorded fighter in human history, capable of taking on some classes of light warships thanks to its heavier armament and more developed shield matrix. It even sports a miniscule amount of cargo space, thanks to the main access shaft doubling as a storage compartment. Compared to other fighters, however, it is considered rather slow, and it suffers from poor heat dissipation."

	description "Not to be outdone by the Syndicate, Betelgeuse shipyards began designing an upgrade to their perennial classic ship, the Behemoth. In the end, they produced one of the most powerful ships in human space, its massive armament tempered only by its lackluster weapon capacity. That, and its prohibitively massive cost."

	description `In common pirate slang, a ship that's "hackney" has been assembled, or "hacked", together from the components of multiple ships; usually captured ones. This results in a disjointed ship, typically with a weaker hull than another ship its size, but the customizeability in armament and system capacity is considered worth the concession by pirate outlaws.`
	description "As hackney ships like this one are often cobbled together from boarded or salvaged ship components, there's typically much room for improvement in their kits."

	description "With larger merchant convoys capable of fielding heavier armaments without escorts popping up in the galaxy, the Syndicate needed a new edge to continue to push numbers.

The resulting ship is able to contend with even the largest of Navy ships, but requires a costly license to own and operate."

	description "The Bulk Freighter's design left much to be desired on the fronts of speed and defense, resulting in an overall frail and difficult to use ship that didn't pull in the merchant market like the Syndicate wanted it to.

	description "In the mess of combat, some captains find combat drones a liability: Weak and easy to destroy, drones don't have an easy time finding a niche in front line combat. However, anti-missile turrets, which also use AI for operation, are a remarkably good fit for automata; able to be strapped onto an easily mobile platorm, a small swarm of anti-missile drones can lock down even large missile systems."
	description "Unfortunately, the light model is very restrictive; a custom power cell had to be designed just to accomodate using such a powerful gun aboard such a tiny ship, and there was no opportunity to include a shield matrix of any kind. The light model is faster than its heavier brother, though, so some merchants will scrape by with the light model if they expect to be safe from pirates."
